Task ID: 2-9
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Cinematic landing + all portals + shared infra + wiring + verification

Work Log:
- Built cinematic landing page (CinematicLanding.tsx) with animated gold SGTX hexagonal logo (rotating sovereign ring, drawing hexagon, interlocking S motif, converging rings, particle field, scan beam, marquee ticker). 4-phase entrance: Boot → Seal → Reveal → Ready. Skip-intro + "Enter the Platform" CTA.

  • Trader Seller: same + Dual-Mode toggle, Pending Requests, Quote & Packing Builder (AI price band, non-uniform layers).

- Wired cross-portal navigation: clicking any USTN (in any portal's ShipmentsVault or Command Center) opens the shared TCC overlay; TCC "back" returns to the portal. All portals share the USTN-linked truth layer.
- Fixed Prisma schema: added FinancingRequest.borrower relation with back-relation on Tenant (was causing 500 on TCC load).
- Fixed JSX parsing: escaped `>` as `&gt;` in text content.
- Fixed lint: setState-in-effect (wrapped in setTimeout) and require-import disable for verify script.
